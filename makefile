# Visibility Quantifiers
# external − External functions are meant to be called by other contracts. They cannot be used for internal calls.
# public   − Public functions/variables can be used both externally and internally. For public state variables, Solidity automatically creates a getter function.
# internal − Internal functions/variables can only be used internally or by derived contracts.
# private  − Private functions/variables can only be used internally and not even by derived contracts.
#
# Variable Location Options
# Storage  - It is where all state variables are stored. Because state can be altered in a contract (for example, within a function), storage variables must be mutable. However, their location is persistent, and they are stored on the blockchain.
# Memory   - Reserved for variables that are defined within the scope of a function. They only persist while a function is called, and thus are temporary variables that cannot be accessed outside this scope (ie anywhere else in your contract besides within that function). However, they are mutable within that function.
# Calldata - Is an immutable, temporary location where function arguments are stored, and behaves mostly like memory.

# These commands start the Ethereum node and provide examples of attaching
# directly with potential commands to try, and creating a new account if necessary.

# This is start Ethereum in developer mode. Only when a transaction is pending will
# Ethereum mine a block. It provides a minimal environment for development.
geth-up:

# This will signal Ethereum to shutdown.
geth-down:

# This will remove the local blockchain and let you start new.
geth-reset:
	rm -rf zarf/ethereum/geth/

# This is a JS console environment for making geth related API calls.
geth-attach:
	geth attach --datadir zarf/ethereum/

# This will add a new account to the keystore. The account will have a zero
# balance until you give it some money.

	geth --datadir zarf/ethereum/ account new

# This will deposit 1 ETH into the two extra accounts from the coinbase account.
# Do this if you delete the geth folder and start over or if the accounts need money.
